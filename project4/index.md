Bond issued by Apple with CUSIP: 037833AT7, maturity in 5/6/2044

**Duration** is a **linear approximation** of the bondâ€™s price sensitivity to interest rate changes, calculated by taking the first derivative of the bond's price with respect to yield. However, the relationship between price and yield is not linear; it is a **convex** shape. The duration linear approximation will always **overstate** decreases in bond prices when rates increase, and always **understate** increases in bond prices when interest rates fall. Because of this, the linear approximation **only** works well for **small changes** in interest rates, since the gap between the price/yield relationship and duration is small. For **large changes** in interest rates, you need to account for **convexity** (the curvature) of the price/yield relationship to get a **better approximation** of the bond's price sensitivity. This is done by taking the second derivative of the bond's price with respect to the yield. Convexity is a benefit to bondholders as it means bond prices fall less and rise more than a straight line would suggest. 

**The excel file below graphs the price/yield relationship of an Apple security maturing in 5/6/2044. Moving the **pink slider** displays a **sensitivity analysis** for rising and falling interest rates at different rates**, showing the corresponding duration, convexity, and price movement on the graph. This gives a better understanding on how bond prices react to interest rate changes, and how duration and convexity together provide a more accurate estimate of price sensitivity, especially for larger interest rate movements.
