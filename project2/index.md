## Boston Home Prices Machine Learning Analysis

This project examines the key factors influencing Boston home prices using **machine learning models (KNN algorithm, step-wise regression, random forest).** The goal is to understand which factors drive **median home values (medv)** and to identify the best predictive model. We have 13 predictor variables to work with which can result in a large number of possible models. In this project, we will use a model with all 13 predictors (model 1), a model derived by analyzing correlations and random forest (model 2), and a model selected using step-wise regression (model 3). Then we‚Äôll measure the **predictive accuracy** of these models by creating training and test data sets, using the training data to predict the test data, and analyze the **performance results.**
