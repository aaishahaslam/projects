# LLY Acquisition
## (in progress)


## This group project is an analysis of Eli Lilly and Company's acquisition on DICE Therapeutics, a biotech company in South San Francisco in Summer 2023. It includes the earnings impact from a stock vs cash transaction

### Target and Acquirer Background

**Acquirer**
Eli Lilly, based in Indianapolis, is one of the largest competitors in their
industry with 39,000 employees and a market cap of over $600 billion
with access to numerous markets across the globe. LLY is a mature firm
that was founded in 1876 and has acquired numerous other companies
since their inception. Their revenue growth has remained relatively steady
year-over-year and have over $2 billion of cash on hand.

**Target**
Headquartered in San Francisco, DICE is a small therapeutic firm with 71 employees
and an equity value of 567 million. As a recently founded firm, DICE has
few competitors other than its own in getting itself into the green. They
increased their value from 204 million at IPO to 1.752 billion when
purchased by LLY. DICE has a strong asset base with over $500 million in
cash on hand as of last quarter and shown consistent revenue growth from
the time of their inception.

### Synergies
**Reasons for merger: Synergies**
Dice Therapeutics developed one type of drug in the immunology space, namely the DELSCAPE
platform. This proprietary platform shows promising results in the treatment of
long-term and chronic autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. The DELSCAPE
platform has a combination of different features that make it appealing to the
medical industry and the public. This space is fairly new, so potential innovations
could be incredibly valuable. Although Eli Lilly had similar drugs, analysts must
have seen better results from the DELSCAPE platform, making this a horizontal
merger, due to their prior competitor status.

**Comparisons of synergies for current deal vs potential deals**
Similar targets for this acquisition likely included Argenx, Numab Therapeutics,
Ventyx, and Revolution Medicines, who are also currently developing PPI
focused drugs similar to that of Dice Therapeutics. The listed companies differ in
size with Argenx (ARGX) and Revolution Medicines (RVMD) being publicly
traded and valued at ~$22.4 billion and ~$4.5 billion, respectively. Targets are
viewed differently in the biomedical space due to the heavy emphasis on
proprietary technology and development, making it difficult to commercialize
drugs that are subject to proprietary restrictions. According to several articles, there were other large biotech companies interested in Dice Therapeutics. This included AbbVie, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Johnson & Johnson, and Merck2 all large-cap established companies.

## Earnings Impact

## Market Analysis

**Worldwide trends**- Global M&A fell 20% in 2023 (when the deal was completed) compared to 2022
to a total value of about $3 trillion. The Fed’s rate hikes ontributed to an overall uncertain
economic outlook, causing companies to hold off on deals until they were more
certain about the economy’s future. Multiples on strategic deals hit a
15-year low in 2023 as well. Private equity firms also purchased smaller stakes in
a company to sidestep refinancing a seller’s debt at a higher interest rate. They
also purchased most, but not all, of a target firm to allow the firm to keep a
portion of the equity in their portfolio in the event of a rebound.

**Industry trends**- Declining incidence of COVID-19, colds, influenza,
and RSV other than the traditional uptick during cold and flu season.
Retail pharmacies declined steadily, with almost 700 closing in the U.S.
during 2022-2023. This shows the decline of a distributor for
pharmaceutical/health service companies, with more online options
becoming available. pharmaceutical industry moved similarly to the S&P 500 throughout
2023. However, after the deal between Eli Lilly and DiCE Therapeutics,
September saw a large gap develop between the pharmaceutical index and
the S&P 500. Additionally, the Russia-Ukraine war caused a strain on the
global supply chain. Specifically, this caused a rise in prescription drug
prices, with an average rise of 31.6% from July 2021 to July 2022. High inflation, talent shortages, rising capital costs, foreign exchange
impacts, and scrutiny from the Federal Trade Commission are all factors
affecting the market surrounding pharmaceuticals.
