# Project 3

## This group project is an analysis of Eli Lilly and Company's acquisition on DICE Therapeutics, a biotech company in South San Francisco in Summer 2023. It includes ___

### Market Analysis
A. Worldwide trends- Global M&A fell 20% in 2023 (when the deal was completed) compared to 2022
to a total value of about $3 trillion. The Fed’s rate hikes ontributed to an overall uncertain
economic outlook, causing companies to hold off on deals until they were more
certain about the economy’s future. Multiples on strategic deals hit a
15-year low in 2023 as well. Private equity firms also purchased smaller stakes in
a company to sidestep refinancing a seller’s debt at a higher interest rate. They
also purchased most, but not all, of a target firm to allow the firm to keep a
portion of the equity in their portfolio in the event of a rebound.

B. Industry trends- Declining incidence of COVID-19, colds, influenza,
and RSV other than the traditional uptick during cold and flu season.
Retail pharmacies declined steadily, with almost 700 closing in the U.S.
during 2022-2023. This shows the decline of a distributor for
pharmaceutical/health service companies, with more online options
becoming available. pharmaceutical industry moved similarly to the S&P 500 throughout
2023. However, after the deal between Eli Lilly and DiCE Therapeutics,
September saw a large gap develop between the pharmaceutical index and
the S&P 500. Additionally, the Russia-Ukraine war caused a strain on the
global supply chain. Specifically, this caused a rise in prescription drug
prices, with an average rise of 31.6 percent from July 2021 to July 2022. High inflation, talent shortages, rising capital costs, foreign exchange
impacts, and scrutiny from the Federal Trade Commission are all factors
affecting the market surrounding pharmaceuticals.
