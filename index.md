- [Retail Sales Forecasting Project 🛍️](./project1/) (COMPLETE ✓)
  - This project investigates which time series model best predicts retail sales in Queensland’s clothing industry using data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. After identifying strong trend and   multiplicative seasonality in the data, ETS models—specifically ETS(M,A,M) and its damped version ETS(M,Ad,M) were evaluated for their forecasting accuracy. In-sample fit and out-of-sample forecasting were assessed using RMSE, followed by a rolling window cross-validation. Autocorrelation plots were also compared to investigate whether temporal dependence remained in the data.
